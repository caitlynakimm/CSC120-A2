Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think what worked for me was understanding how to rewrite the methods in object-oriented programming (ex. adding self as a parameter for each method, creating instance variables). I think what didn't work was understanding what code from the procedural_resale_shop module I should take and rewrite for my Computer and ResaleShop classes. Advice I would give to a future CS 120 student is to definitely go to TA office hours, they are amazing people that help break down the homework for you. Shout out to Jessica and Chris you guys saved me.
